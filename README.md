# StonkNibbler
Ever wanted a bot to stack tendies, moonshot stonks, and make you a paper-hand king? Yeah, StonkNibbler isn’t that. But if you’re a true WallStreetBets ape, ready to YOLO into the deep end and hold the bag, this bot’s your vibe. It mashes classical plays, neural net autism, and LLM word salad into a profit-nibbling crap show. MIT-licensed—give credit and take profits!
