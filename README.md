*Hoping for a bot that piles up cash and nails every trade?* Well, **StonkNibbler** isn’t for you. But if you’re into *WallStreetBets* chaos and don’t mind a wild ride, this fits. It mixes classical strategies, neural net quirks, and LLM guesswork into a profit-chasing experiment. **MIT-licensed**—credit me if it pays off (or flops).
